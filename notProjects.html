				Multi-valuation across languages and domains
				<br>
				</div >
				<br>
				Multi-valuation involves one probe being valued by multiple goals, thus receiving multiple values. I look at when one probe receivs two singular values. In the nominal domain, this is illustrated in Nominal Right Node Raising constructions. Two agreement patterns are observed: the Distributive agreement where the multi-valued probe (noun) must be singular (e.g. English Slovenian), the Summative agreement where the multi-valued probe must be plural (Bulgarian, Russian). IN the TP domain, multi-valuation is showcased in T' RNR construction reported in Groß 2015. The Distribution agreement is observed in Slovenian while the Summative agreement is observed in English. I survey around 20 languages and observe a 3/4 pattern regarding the two agreement patterns in two different domains. I propose that multi-valuation shows the Agreement Hierarchy effect proposed for hybrid noun agreement (Corbett 1979 a.o.).

				Agreement with Disjunction
				</div >
				<br>
				Agreement with disjunction is a less studied area despite its unique properties. I look at agreement with disjunction across languages and compare the patterns with that of conjunction agreement. In particular, I look at exclusive disjunction which does not overlap with conjunction regarding interpretation.

				Closest conjunct agreement
				<br>
				</div >
				<br>
				Closest conjunct agreement (CCA), where the linearly closest conjunct controls the agreement, constitutes the most prominent case that the grammar is sensitive to word order. Various analyses for CCA rely on special properties of the conjunction head like 'and' and argue that the linear effect is an illusion. I work on various aspects of CCA including the distance effect, CCA in right node raising construction, and its interacton with coordinate structure constraint.

				<br>
				Cross-linguistically, hybrid nouns like <i>committee</i> can control either morphological agreement and semantic agreement: <i>The committee has/have met.</i> This optionality has motivated a feature theory with both semantic features and former/morphological features. Although formal features have been investigated extensively in both syntax and morphology, the nature of semantic features remains unclear. Multi-valuation provides a useful probe into semantic features. Grosz 2015 argues that semantic number features are referential indexes. However Belk and Neeleman 2018 proposes that semantic agreement results from a repair rule when syntactic agreement is blocked. We show that both a repair approach and a index approach are problematic but a particular combination of the two is descriptively adequate. Currently we are working on extending the empirical scope of semantic agreement to switch reference observed in indigenous languages in North and South America.

				<br>
				Nominal right node raising constructions involve two DPs sharing an constituent, e.g. "this tall and that short student".
				The number marking on the shared element ("student") depends on the type of the sharing elements: "this tall and that short student(*s) 
				are a couple", "John's and Mary's student*(s) are a couple". I conduct a cross-linguistic survey and show that the key factor lies in 
				whether the sharing elements agree with the shared element. I provide a multi-dominance analysis for the construction and argue that 
				when a noun is valued with two instances of singular features, it is spelled out as singular rather than plural or dual, unlike
				verbal elements in TP RNR (Grosz 2015) and local effects (Gluckman 2015).

				<br>
				Previous acquisition literature on superlatives focuses on the emergence of superlative morphology in children's production. <a href="http://lyntieu.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Lyn Tieu</a> and I have conducted corpus and experimental studies to probe children's knowledge of the different interpretations of superlative expressions. Previous studies report children's difficulties in interpreting superlative expressions as adults do. We found that Question under Discussion (QuD) to be crucial in probing children's ability to interpret ambiguous expressions. Once the QuD is made salient, children largely behave like adults in interpreting "the largest cake by Monkey". However, there is some difference between interpreting fragment answers and full answers.

				<h4>On the backburner</h4>
				<div align="center" style="font-size:1.1em">Fragment Answer and Superlatives</div>
				<br>
				A number of approaches have been proposed to derive fragment answers. Most of the arguments center on the mobility and the island 
				sensitivity of the fragment. This project takes a different route and teases apart the various approaches by examining the interpretative 
				differences between the fragment answer and the full answer. In superlatives in English, the availability of the relative reading with NP 
				internal focus (RIN) is facilitated by overt movement and not covert movement, which provides a test case regarding whether fragment answers 
				involve overt movement. The fact that fragment answers, but not their full-sentence counterparts, allow the RIN shows that at least some fragment answers 
				involve overt movement in narrow syntax.

				<br>
				In addition to the absolute reading and the relative reading of superlative expressions like "the best album by U2", Pancheva and Tomaszewicz (2013) 
				observe a third reading that involves an NP internal focus (RIN) in Polish and Bulgarian. I extend the empirical scope of the inquiry in both Polish-type 
				languages and English-type languages, showing that overt, but not covert movement, facilitates the availability of the third reading. I argue that the generalization is a conspiracy 
				of semantic requirements and syntactic locality constraints.
